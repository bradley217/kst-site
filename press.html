											&quot;Soprano Kara Shay Thomson is a force to be reckoned with...&quot;</p>
										<p class="publication">Palm Beach Daily News</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;Kara Shay Thomson as the Princess Turandot is stunning. She has one of the most powerful voices I have ever heard. Her countenance physically changed from cold to hot when she allowed her feelings for Prince Calaf to melt her icy heart.&quot;</p>
										<p class="publication">broadwayworld.com</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;Sarasota has cast Kara Shay Thomson, a fine dramatic soprano who has essayed the title roles in Tosca and Vanessa, and Leonora in Fidelio, all parts for a singer with stamina but still short of Wagner requirements. Thomson brings a touch more warmth to "the ice princess" than is the norm and is a plus&quot;</p>
										<p class="publication">talkinbroadway.com</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;This is Thomson’s seventh season with Sarasota Opera, and probably her best outing yet. The role of Turandot, though involved in only a few major scenes, is one of the most demanding for sopranos, and she carried it off well. It lies high in the voice and the singer must really know how to pace and conserve for the big moments. Thomson did all this and more, showing the gradual thawing of her icy princess and final capitulation to love in the final scene. In every way a standout performance.&quot;</p>

										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;In the two most recent seasons, Kara Shay Thomson gave Dayton excellent portrayals of Turandot and Madga Sorel in Menotti’s Consul. Singing Salome for the first time, she was outstanding. As an actress, she was asked to do less in this production than might be the case otherwise, but drama was not shirked. For instance, her reactions to the changing orchestral music as Jochanaan returned to the cistern after rejecting her were striking. Vocally, she gave a memorable performance. The voice is sizeable, with a bright, clear top register. She had no trouble riding the big orchestral climaxes in the final scene, and she also floated some lovely soft singing.&quot;</p>

											&quot;As Salome, Kara Shay Thomson, returns for her fifth 'title' role. Each one, an absolute triumph. She is, to me, the greatest dramatic soprano extant. No matter the role, icy Turandot, flamboyant Tosca, desperate Sieglinde, politically imprisoned Magda Sorel, she brings life on stage, often bigger than life.&quot;</p>

										</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;Kara Shay Thomson is the obvious star of the show. When she first appears onstage, dressed in stark magenta amid a sea of muted costumes, she shines. She is able to express the most peaceful contentedness when singing with her servants in the woods...She can also be antagonizing, a match for King Solomon’s impassioned fervor. She manages to invoke a sense of primal sadness in response to Adoniram’s death with a raw cry that leaves the viewer with a deep remorse and an overwhelming urge to applaud.&quot;</p>

											&quot;Kara Shay Thomson appears as the Queen, with a soaring soprano that expresses both love and power.&quot;</p>
										<p class="publication">The Boston Musical Intelligencer</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;In her company debut, soprano Kara Shay Thomson made for a wonderfully elegant Balkis.&quot;</p>
										<p class="publication">The Boston Globe</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;As Balkis, Kara Shay Thomson sang with a soft but plush soprano that flowered beautifully in the upper register. The singer convincingly conveyed the queen’s torn feelings over duty and passion. In the Act 3 aria 'Plus grand dans son obscurité,' her voice trembled with sweet sadness as the queen longed to forget her newfound feelings for Adoniram. In their final duet, Thomson’s singing swelled with overwhelming sorrow and horror over her lover’s demise.&quot;</p>

										<p class="publication">Richmond-Times Dispatch</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;Soprano Kara Shay Thomson, in a strong company debut as Agathe, showed impeccable breath support and luscious tone in the Act II prayer scene. In the equally striking first scene of Act III, Thomson gauged the power of her voice appropriately to the room, creating confident swells up to soaring notes that still retained a virginal quality.

										</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;Soprano Kara Shay Thomson sang a great Magda, always well balanced in all the registers, going from emotional to violent with great ease and musical conviction. Her ‘To this we’ve come,’ received thunderous applause.
											&quot;</p>
										<p class="publication">Opera News</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;Soprano Kara Shay Thomson (already having given a spectacular turn in last season’s Tosca) performed a remarkable Magda, carrying the role from frightened and relatively naïve young mother and wife to embittered fighter and defeated victim of the political process. Her evolution as singer and performer in the role did much to highlight the Pulitzer Prize-winning music.
											&quot;</p>
										<p class="publication">Miami Times</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;From top to bottom, the FGO cast is close to perfect. Magda Sorel demands a singing actress with extraordinary musical and dramatic gifts. Kara Shay Thomson is riveting, completely commanding the stage in every scene. Voicing her pleas in a radiant soprano with a laser-like edge at the top, Thomson was the embodiment of a compassionate woman caught in a web of heartless regulation. Appropriately, her Act II aria ‘To This We’ve Come’ was the high point of the evening, a heartrending outpouring of emotion and harbinger of the tragedy to come.

										</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;Soprano Kara Shay Thomson, who starred in FGO’s Tosca last year, wrung every ounce of passion from proletariat everywoman Magda. Her second-act closing aria more than earned the extended ovation from the opening crowd as Magda pled to see the consul and then exploded in a denunciation of the heartless machine.
											&quot;</p>
										<p class="publication">Florida Theater Onstage</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;It is hard to imagine The Consul being mounted without a cast able to scale these dangerous heights. Florida Grand Opera secured the giant vocal and dramatic talents of Kara Shay Thomson. Magda has not a pleasant moment, yet Thomson demonstrates solid dignity right up to her horrifying end. The voice soars, her diction is spot on, the character is completely explored.

										</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;Kara Shay Thomson gave an elegant performance as Leonore in Fidelio ... a welcome foray into Beethoven’s only opera. Thomson, known for her Tosca with Sarasota and other regional companies, was a galvanizing vocal presence right from 'Komm, Hoffnung,' spontaneous and powerful in her Act I aria to faithful married love.
											&quot;</p>
										<p class="publication">Opera News</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;Kara Shay Thomson ... managed the difficult music’s every detail impressively, with shining spinto tone for dead-on high notes but also the requisite agility. Moreover, her commitment and deep feeling shaped the whole opera, as they must for a successful Leonore.
											&quot;</p>
										<p class="publication">Gay City News</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;Kara Shay Thomson is an inspired actress, and brought committed characterization to the faithful Leonora.... she brought undeniable excitement to the climax of the dungeon scene and sang with passion, dedication and technical security throughout.

										</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;The role of Leonore calls for a truly courageous and engaging performance. There’s no fluttering 
											around in gorgeous costumes, reclining in romantic poses, or lovely shoe-gazing melancholy to hide behind
											here. Soprano Kara Shay Thomson is the main reason that this production succeeds so well. Her handling of 
											the character delivers the compassionate heart without sacrificing the strength and bravery of Leonore’s 
											actions. And, of course, there’s the singing. In the aria, ‘Komm, Hoffnung, Lass den Letzten Stern,’ Thomson 
											was spectacular. The song describes the intensity of her horror at Pizarro’s plan, but also the hope that 
											sustains her as she tries to save her husband. Thomson’s plush voice fills the room, rich, nuanced, fully 
											in control of each phrase and delicate note. She was brilliant throughout.
											&quot;</p>
										<p class="publication">Louisville.com</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;Ms. Kara Shay Thomson. She gets better and better with every time I hear her lush and enticing voice.
											Her Leonore/Fidelio is no exception. From Leonore‘s Komm, Hoffnung, lass den letzten Stern (Come, hope let the last star)
											dreaming and praying for her husband, to Fidelio’s Wie kalt ist es in diesem unterirdischen Gewölbe! (How cold it is down here!),
											Ms. Thomson shows fantastic range and versatility. Not to mention, a huge nod to the make-up artists and costumers
											that had the task of making the lovely Ms. Thomson less womanly.

											&quot;Her [Leonore's] transformation is internal, and as she gathers the courage to face all of the

											soprano in the aria 'Abscheulicher! Wo eilst du hin?'

											&quot;The wandering soprano, Kara Shay Thomson in her City Opera debut, sang beautifully ranging from anxiety 
											to full erotic feeling. Another soprano who sang this piece recently in New York retired for years to a nunnery

											&quot;For "Erwartung," a kind of fever dream of a woman stumbling over the body of her dead lover in a forest, the rich-voiced

										<p class="publication">The Wall Street Journal</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;Following a striking entr’acte scored by video artist Jennifer Steinkamp, formidable soprano Kara Shay Thomson 
											gave a performance of Schoenberg’s Erwartung that was flush with imagery and dramatic heft and light on the chewier 
											notoriety that 12-tone music has gained.&quot;</p>
										<p class="publication">WQXR.com</p>
										<p class="review alignjustify">
											&quot;By means of transition, the burkas came back into view, this time revealing soprano Kara Shay Thomson in a white 
											fin-de-siecle dress along with a half dozen identically dressed dancers. In Erwartung, these doppelgangers became an 
											effective metaphor for conflicting facets of the heroine’s psyche, one moment crouching over the prostate body of her 
											lover in fascination, the next recoiling in horror. Thomson sang the part with great emotional commitment and displayed 
											a luscious warm sound that she was able to produce evenly across the range – a requirement for a part so full of jagged 
											jumps.&quot;</p>

											&quot;Kara Shay Thomson’s soprano is so plush and sensuous that it must have taken some real restraint to deliver a

											she did, singing in a chaste manner, with feathery high notes, sensitive phrasing and climactic notes that rang through
											the hall without overpowering the delicacy of the aria. Thomson let loose the richness of her voice in her Act 1 love
											scene with Cavaradossi, with fervent, ringing high notes. In her scene with Scarpia she was entirely convincing in her

											&quot;Kara Shay Thomson made a spectacular company debut as the tempestuous title diva. The American soprano has a big, bright
